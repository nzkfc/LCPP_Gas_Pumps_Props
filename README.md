# lcpp_gas_pumps_props

Adds fuel pump props to the map for the Liberty City Preservation Project: https://worldtravel.dev/

Thanks to hrdbdyz and his LegacyFuel for LC script edit, for easier access to where each gas station was: https://discord.com/channels/1297057471034167369/1323872021293306007/1323872021293306007

Includes all LC native gas stations and includes two custom fueling scenes at the Airport and Airdock landing pads for Helicopters.

## How To Install:
1. Place the `lc_gas_pumps` folder into your FiveM/RP Framework resources folder, e.g., `[defaultmaps]` or whatever you use.
2. No need to edit `server.cfg` as `[defaultmaps]` will be in there by default. If you dumped the folder into the `resources` folder on its own, add `ensure lc_gas_pumps` to your `server.cfg` towards the bottom of your resources list.
